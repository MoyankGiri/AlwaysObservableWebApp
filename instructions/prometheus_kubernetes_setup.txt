Why prometheus operator?
Ans: it reduces theeffort of configuration, implementation and management of entire prometheus monitoring stack on k8 allowing dynamic update of resources

Steps to setup:
1.Deploy prometheus operator onto the cluster
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml

2.verify crds
kubectl get crds

3.verify if operator was created
kubectl get deploy

4.verify if service has been created
kubectl get service

5.prom needs access to k8 apis to scrape targets. hence we need to give appropriate permissions to access the resources via clusterRoles.
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml

6.check if role was created
kubectl describe clusterrolebinding prometheus

7.create prometheus pod
kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml

8.check if it is running
kubectl get prometheus

9.check if service is running
kubectl get services

10.access prom ui by port forwarding
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-operated 9090:9090

11.prom operators use PodMonitors to identify pods to be scraped by prom.
Hence PostPodMonitor.yaml uses a label to select which service to monitor and which metrics to scrape ie the label we use is app:postmicroservice since we want to scrape the app postmicroservice and since we have started_http_client @ port:6996, we use this port number

kubectl apply -f PostPodMonitor.yaml
